# AGENTS.md

Scoped execution guidance for the initial greenfield build.

Base project rules live in `../../AGENTS.md`.

## Scope

- Run greenfield execution commands from this directory: `plans/greenfield/`
- This file applies only to the initial project build tracked by `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- Feature work belongs in `features/<name>/`

## Required Context

Before starting a task, read:
1. `../../AGENTS.md`
2. `../PLAN_STATUS.md` and confirm this directory is active, or that the user
   explicitly directed work in this planned directory
3. `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`
4. `TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`
5. `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
6. `../../LEARNINGS.md` if it exists

## Task Loop

1. Start fresh for each new task.
2. Read the task definition and its acceptance criteria from `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
3. Confirm prior dependencies are complete.
4. Default to TDD for behavior changes: add or update a failing automated test first, then implement the minimum fix and refactor with tests green.
5. Implement the minimum change needed to satisfy the task.
6. Verify using the metadata in `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and `.claude/verification-config.json`.
7. Update completed checkboxes in `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
8. Inspect `git status`, stage only the intended task files, and commit after
   verification passes using `task({id}): {description} [REQ-XXX]`.

## Verification

- All acceptance criteria must be satisfied before a task is complete.
- Run configured test, typecheck, lint, and build commands when available.
- Before asking for manual verification, try to verify directly using this order:
  1. repo-native verification scripts/tests
  2. local CLI tools
  3. direct API or SDK calls
  4. MCP tools
  5. browser automation or Computer Use
  If blocked, record attempted tools/commands, outcomes, and the next viable
  option before declaring a human-only blocker.
- If an acceptance criterion uses browser or manual verification, follow the
  execution and checkpoint skills for that verification type.
- If verification metadata is missing, add it before proceeding.

## When To Stop And Ask

Stop and ask the human if:
- a dependency, file, or service is missing
- secrets or environment variables are required
- requirements conflict or are ambiguous
- verification keeps failing and the cause is not clear
- the task appears to require out-of-scope architectural changes

## Blocker Report

Use this format when blocked:

```text
BLOCKED: Task {id}
Issue: {what is wrong}
Tried: {what you attempted}
Need: {what would unblock}
Type: user-action | dependency | external-service | unclear-requirements
```
